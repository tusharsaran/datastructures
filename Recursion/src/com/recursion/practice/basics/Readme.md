# Name Reversal
this method is to reverse the given name as part of the parameter.
<p> for e.g. if the input is "SURUCHI" so the output we are looking is the reversal of the name - "IHCURUS"</p>

<br>
<h3> Here is the code snippet </h3>

    private static String reverseNameRecursive(String theName){
        if(theName.length() == 0) {
          return "please provide a logical name;
        }
        return (reverseNameRecursive(theName.substring(1)) + theName.charAt(0)) ;
      }
 
 <br>
 <h3>The above code we can also write like this to get a better understanding of what exactly is happening:</h3>
 
     private static String reverseNameRecursive(String theName){
        String name = null;
        if(theName.length() == 0) {
          return theName;
        }
         name =  reverseNameRecursive(theName.substring(1));
         String output =  name + theName.charAt(0);

         return output;
      }

 
 <b>Lets assume we are providing input "Aaru" as the name.</b>
 
     - Now what we are doing here is we are first checking if theName.length == 0 the name length of  Aaru is 4 which is 
     definitely greater than 0 so it will skip the if case and go to the code at line 20 i.e.
     name =  reverseNameRecursive(theName.substring(1));
     So reverseNameRecursive("Aaru") is calling the recursive method reverseNameRecursive("aru") with value "aru" 
     ("Aaru".substring(1)) so jvm will keep the method `reverseNameRecursive("Aaru")` in stack.

    - Now since we dont know the value of reverseNameRecursive("aru") so it is going to call method and first check if the 
    lenght ==0 since the length is greater than 0 it will then go to the next step and call the recursive method 
    reverseNameRecursive("ru"). Jvm will keep `reverseNameRecursive("aru")` in stack.

    - reverseNameRecursive("ru") will do the same process i.e. checking the length in this case also the value is greater than 0
    so it will call recursive method again and calls reverseNameRecursive("u"). Jvm will keep the method in  
    `reverseNameRecursive("ru")` in stack.

    - reverseNameRecursive("u") will again check the length first and since it is greater than zero calls the 
    `reverseNameRecursive("")`. Jvm will keep reverseNameRecursive("u") method in stack.

    - Now reverseNameRecursive("") is called and it will check the lenght of the input this time the input ==0 so it will return
    output as `theName i.e. empty`
