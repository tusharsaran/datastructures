<h2> Tree </h2>

We use Tree Data structure in our day to day life. There are so many examples where we use tree data structure.
Lets see oe of the example here: 

<b> Let's say we are planning to buy a Computer device for mailing.. </b>

OR another example is of folder structure in computer

<b>Tree: </b>  

- In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a   
  parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
- A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. 
- A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one root and zero or one or more subtrees.

<br> <br>
<b>Properties of tree: </b>

- Represents data in hierachicalform 
- Each node consist of 2 elements (Data and reference of subtree node)
- It has a root node and 2 subtree called left tree and right tree

<h3>Need of Tree in Data structure</h3>

<p>IS Array and Linken List not sufficient for data stucture ?</p> 
<p> Why do we need a tree and what advantage it will give that the other data structure specially Array and Linked List does not have. To understand this lets see the time complexity and the space complecity of Array and Linked List : </p>
<br>

<br>

<p>In array, If you notice the space efficiency is not good i.e once you created an array you cannot increase the array. For that you have to create a new array with extra space and copy the current array and place it in the new array which is a very costly operation.</p>
<p> Similarly in Linked List some of the operations like insertion, deletion, searching, traversing is a costly operation (Time Complexity is O(n))</p> 
  
  
 Because of these issue we need a data structure that is cost and space efficient and therefore we introcuced Tree.
