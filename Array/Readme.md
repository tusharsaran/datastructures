<h2>Array:</h2>
is a datastructure consisting of the collection of simiar data type elements each identified by array index. An array is stored
such that the position of each element can be computed from its indec cell by a mathematical formulae. What that means is that
if you have an array then u can find the number in array from the first index.

<b>e.g. of Array :</b> Array of Integer with size 9 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
           12
    </td>
     <td>
           2
    </td>
     <td>
           5
    </td>  
    <td>
           67
    </td>
    <td>
          452

     <td>
           36
    </td>    
  </tr>

<b>e.g. of Array :</b> Array of char with size 5
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
           'g'
    </td>
     <td>
           'q'
    </td>
     <td>
           'y'
    </td>

           'p'
    </td>
    <td>
          'd'
    </td>
  </tr>

<b>Properties of an array :</b>
  - every cell of an array has a unique index
  - index starts with 0
  - array can store data of specified data type i.e. if its an integer array one cannot store char or String or 
  any other data type.
  - It has contiguous memory location
  - Size of an array needs to be mandatorily specified and cannot be modified. Once you are creating an array u have to define
  the size of an array. Once the array is created u cannot increase or decrease the size if of an array.Thats one of the 
  limitaion of an array.
