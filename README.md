# Data structures:
Data Structure is a way to 'organize data' in a way that enables it to be processed in an effiient time.

# Types of Data Structures:

Logical Data structure are dependent on Physical DS for their implementation as they have their own concept that means the 
way to do the calculation but when it comes to implementation they are completely dependent o Physical DS. 

Lets say you want to implement stack so it will either use Array or Linled List for the implementation same goes for 
other Logical DS.
